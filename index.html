		<h2>Autobiography</h2>
		<p>
		I am a sophomore studying Computer Science, Finance, and Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Duke University. I first started using a computer when my dad built me a personal computer when I was 11. Since then I have used PCs ranging from gaming laptops to personal desktops.</p><p> I use computers on a daily basis to browse Facebook, stream videos on YouTube, conduct research, play videogames, read textbooks, stream music, and much more.</p>
		<p>I remember my first computer programming course in freshman year of high school was quite impactful in me deciding to major in Computer Science as I remembered the happiness I felt in completing my first program and actually taking an executable of it with me on my flash drive to show my family at home. At the end of the course, I created my own calculator and decided to use that for quite some time. I've always loved problem-solving and the rush I feel when I finish a chunk of code is addictive.</p><p> My technical skills include Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, and Flask.</p>
